challenge: "Designing for AIGI was more than building a website—it was about creating a culturally respectful digital platform that could speak to and support Indigenous communities across Australia. \nThe challenge was to reflect deep cultural identity while ensuring the platform was modern, accessible, easy to manage, and able to grow with the organization’s needs.\nWe needed to balance heritage and modernity, storytelling and functionality—all while staying aligned with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander design principles."
solution: "Culturally-Informed Visual Language\nDynamic Banner Imagery with Textural Layers\nFlexible Content Types with Consistent UI Logic\nAccessible, Community-Centered Navigation\nComponent-Based Design System"

outcome: "Learnit has been in the game for 25+ years—helping people and teams grow with purpose. Not just learning for learning’s sake, but practical, proven training that actually sticks. Learnit came to us with a site that technically worked—but emotionally, it missed the mark. It didn’t reflect the energy in their classrooms. It didn’t capture that flash of clarity when someone learns something they can actually use.\L\r\nSo we asked: how do you design for a breakthrough?\r\nWe didn’t start with wireframes. We started with conversations—about people, growth, and the quiet confidence that comes from learning something real. From there, the strategy became clear: simplify the experience, elevate the story, and let humanity lead. Visuals that say:\_“We see you. We’ve got you.”"

AIGI is an Australian organisation dedicated to strengthening governance within Indigenous communities. Their work provides knowledge-sharing, training, and professional development opportunities to support self-determination, cultural legitimacy, and community wellbeing.

My role was to help bring that mission to life online—by creating a website that not only functions smoothly, but also reflects the depth and diversity of Indigenous design. From the early stages, I worked closely with the AIGI team to follow culturally informed design guidelines, ensuring that the final result felt respectful, accessible, and visually grounded in community.

### Design Highlights – Inspired by Culture, Grounded in UX
Throughout the project, I focused on blending strong UX foundations with culturally respectful design. Every element—from layout to visual language—was shaped to support Indigenous governance, storytelling, and engagement.
